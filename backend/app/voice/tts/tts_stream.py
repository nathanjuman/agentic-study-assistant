    Transform stream: Voice Events → Voice Events (with Audio)

    This function takes a stream of upstream voice agent events and processes them.
    When agent_chunk events arrive, it sends the text to Cartesia for TTS synthesis.
    Audio is streamed back as tts_chunk events as it's generated.
    All upstream events are passed through unchanged.

    It uses merge_async_iters to combine two concurrent streams:
    - process_upstream(): Iterates through incoming events, yields them for
      passthrough, and sends agent text chunks to Cartesia for synthesis.
    - tts.receive_events(): Yields audio chunks from Cartesia as they are
      synthesized.

    The merge utility runs both iterators concurrently, yielding items from
    either stream as they become available. This allows audio generation to
    begin before the agent has finished generating all text, minimizing latency.

    Args:
        event_stream: An async iterator of upstream voice agent events

    Yields:
        All upstream events plus tts_chunk events for synthesized audio

        This async generator serves two purposes:
        1. Pass through all upstream events (stt_chunk, stt_output, agent_chunk)
           so downstream consumers can observe the full event stream.
        2. Buffer agent_chunk text and send to Cartesia when agent_end arrives.
           This ensures the full response is sent at once for better TTS quality.
